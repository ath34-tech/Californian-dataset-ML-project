# Californian-dataset-ML-project

This is my first machine learning project, i followed tutorial in book "hands on ML with scikit learn and tensorflow".

## what i did different?
Well i made different transformers and pipeline which handles everything from splitting of data to data procession then model training and prediction to model finetuning.
I prepared entire pipeline and made code cleaner with using custom Transformers.

## how to use it?
Just copy my project and use my scripts in scripts folder to do same with your data. You can reuse this pipeline on your data.
